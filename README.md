Showcase of my projects and papers

I am a final year Computer Science PhD student at CMILab, UF 🎓. Prior to this, I spent 2 wonderful years at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (IISc) studying Artificial Intelligence. During my undergrad, I was fortunate to have worked with Professor Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula 👨‍🏫. I'm really excited about ML models, and more recently Foundation Models in the Digital pathology and omics space 🤖! Seeing algorithms I've developed help identify high-risk patients is something that really motivates me 💡.
