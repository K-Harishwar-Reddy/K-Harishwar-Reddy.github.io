      I’m a third-year PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the Computational Microscopy and Imaging Lab, University of Florida. Before UF, I completed my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, where I had the privilege of working with Professor Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula. I’m passionate about machine learning—especially foundation models in digital pathology and multi-omics—and nothing motivates me more than seeing my algorithms pinpoint high-risk patients.
